    title: Simulation Evaluation (single)
    description: A tool designed for processing hydrological data from multiple catchments, calculating key performance metrics and generating visualizations.
  
    parameters:
      index_column:
        type: string
        default: date
        description: | 
          If the observations and simulations are indexed with a timestamp, you
          may identify the correct column to use here.
      observation_column:
        type: string
        default: obs
        description: | 
         bla
      simulation_column:
        type: string
        optional: true
        description: |
          Specify the column containing the simulated data. If no column is listed,
          then the tool will use **all** columns that are not index or observation columns.
    data:
      simulation_data:
        extension:
          - csv
          - parquet
        description: | 
          Directory where the input data files are stored. The directory should contain
          all the catchment files (including observation and simlation data columns). 
          Each column will be interpreted as an observation or simulation realization, while different 
          files are interpreted as different simulation or simulation scenarios. You may use wildcards to 
          point to more than one input file.
